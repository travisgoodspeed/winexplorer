Howdy y'all,

Voltage glitching is in vogue these days, but nearly a quarter century
ago, it was used for satellite TV piracy.  This repository holds a few
hundred such scripts, poorly organized and sadly with no known
sources.

Each script is written in VBScript for WinExplorer.  You will
need an antique smart card unlooper to run them.
